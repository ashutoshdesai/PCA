# PCA

We will work on three datasets:

1. Covid-19 dataset reports the number of total cases for different countries at the end of each day
2. Covid-19 dataset reports the total number of deaths for each country at the end of each day
3. We will apply PCA to images using the MNIST dataset of handwritten digits

Mainly, the PCA is used to implement dimensionality reduction and best feature selection in a dataset.
